# ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND DATA ANALYTICS ( 2025-2029)

As an undergraduate in AIDA, this repository contains all the coding assignments done as part of
DA 1301 - Programming and Data structures.
When not coding, you can find me humming a song or sweating it out on the badminton court.

## GITHUB - OPENING VISTAS TO THE TECH WORLD

***The best theory is always inspired by practice.***
Github helps track my coding journey and showcase my projects.
I believe in the philosophy that thereâ€™s always a simpler, better way to do something than what pops up in your head.  
By allowing for collab,Github aids in my improvement.

It proved to be both a learning and a very humbling experience.
